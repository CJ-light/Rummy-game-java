# Rummy-game-java
Carlos Juan E. Diaz Vargas
Implementation of Rummy game (only with sets) written in Java. 

## How to Run:
1. In the command line go to the directory of the files
2. Run the command 'java proj2.Proj2' to run main program inside the package.

## How to play:
The Proj2 only runs the option to play with two people (no AI)
1. Player 1 is the first one to play.
2. The player can get a card from either the discard Stack or the Deck.
3. Then they can select cards (can select multiple cards by pressing 'ctrl' while clicking all the cards you want to add) to do one Lay (gotta be in a Set, three or more cards of the same index (number)) or one card to Discard.
4. Then it goes to the next player.
5. Turns keep going like that until one of the players hand is empty or the Deck is empty.
6. If one of the players hand is empty then they win the game. 
7. But instead, if the Deck is empty, then the player that had the hand of cards with the lowest value wins the game.

### Help I've recieved from other people:
1. Victor: He helped me understand how to select multiple values in the GUI and helped me when I got errors when I was trying to create and use my generic MyStack class. (MyStack generic and Stack is the one using that class).

### Help I've given:
1. I've just talked to a lot of people, telling them how I interpret the instructions.
2. And I helped someone that wanted to put a new image in the GUI by telling them to download a different image of the same thing, because I thought the problem was with the image they were trying to display.
